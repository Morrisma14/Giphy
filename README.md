# GifTastic

`GIPHY API used to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of actors`

## How to Use
- Click on an actors name to see some of their gifs!
- When you click on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
- When you click one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If you click the gif again, it should stop playing.
- Add an actor to the list by typing their name into the form.
- Click submit and a button will appear for the actor you added.
